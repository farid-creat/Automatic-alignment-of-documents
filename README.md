# Automatic-alignment-of-documents
In this project, we want to automatically scan a photo of a document that has parts other than the document, extract that part of the document and display it in a separate photo.
here is the sample process of the algorithm
<br>
<img align="center" alt="img1" src="img1.png?raw=true"  title = "It is assumed that the background should be relatively clear" />
<br>
<img align="center" alt="img1" src="img2.png?raw=true" title = "Find the scope of the document" />
<br>

<img align="center" alt="img1" src="img3.png?raw=true"  title = "extract the document "/>
<br>
